# dl_kcat
Machine learning tools for predicting rate constants from enzyme dynamics

### Branches
* **master** -- main working branch
* **weighted_loss** -- where implementation of DenseLoss and DenseWeight, for weighted loss function, was developed (merged)
* **classification** -- where $k_{cat}$ classification, as opposed to regression, is being developed. And where parallel training of CV folds is being developed
