# dl_kcat
Machine learning tools for predicting rate constants from enzyme dynamics

### Branches
* master -- main working branch
* weighted_loss -- where implementation of DenseLoss and DenseWeight, for weighted loss function, was developed (merged)
* classiciation -- where $k_{cat}$ classification, as opposed to regression, is being developed
